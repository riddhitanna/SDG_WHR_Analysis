# SDG and WHR: Data Analysis and Visualization
The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are a collection of 17 interlinked global goals designed to be a blueprint to achieve a better and more sustainable future for all. The SDGs were set in 2015 by the United Nations General Assembly and are intended to be achieved by the year 2030. 
The UN Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN) has been issuing the World Happiness Report for the past few years. Recently, they issued the WHR for 2021.
Fulfillment of various development goals can have an impact on the well-being of people. We analyse the correlation of the these two indices and how various goals contribute to the well-being of people of different regions.

The countries have been divided into 7 categories on the basis of the region they belong to, namely:
OECD, Eastern Europe and Central Asia, LAC, East and South Asia, MENA, Oceania and Africa.

The two datasets have a lot of variables which are interdependent on one another. To identify trends and relations between them, we employ methods of Pearson correlation coefficient and univariate ordinary least squares regression in the Jupyter notebook.
